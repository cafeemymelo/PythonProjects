# Data Science
I created these notebooks to help me through my learning process while studying data science. In them I keep my notes and examples taken from multiples sources.
Some of the sources used in my studies:
* <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/mastering-machine-learning-scikit-learn-second-edition">Mastering Machine Learning with scikit-learn, 2nd Edition</a>
* <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/">Machine Learning - Coursera</a>
